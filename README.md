# myproject

This is a sample project for Databricks, generated via cookiecutter.

While using this project, you need Python 3.X and `pip` or `conda` for package management.

## Local environment setup

1. Instantiate a local Python environment via a tool of your choice. This example is based on `conda`, but you can use any environment management tool:
```bash
conda create -n myproject python=3.9
conda activate myproject
```

2. If you don't have JDK installed on your local machine, install it (in this example we use `conda`-based installation):
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge openjdk=11.0.15
```

3. Install project locally (this will also install dev requirements):
```bash
pip install -e ".[local,test]"
```

## Interactive execution and development on Databricks clusters

1. `dbx` expects that cluster for interactive execution supports `%pip` and `%conda` magic [commands](https://docs.databricks.com/libraries/notebooks-python-libraries.html).
2. Please configure your workflow (and tasks inside it) in `conf/deployment.yml` file.
3. To execute the code interactively, provide either `--cluster-id` or `--cluster-name`.
```bash
dbx execute <workflow-name> \
    --cluster-name="<some-cluster-name>"
```

Multiple users also can use the same cluster for development. Libraries will be isolated per each user execution context.

## Working with notebooks and Repos

To start working with your notebooks from a Repos, do the following steps:

1. Add your git provider token to your user settings in Databricks
2. Add your repository to Repos. This could be done via UI, or via CLI command below:
```bash
databricks repos create --url <your repo URL> --provider <your-provider>
```
This command will create your personal repository under `/Repos/<username>/myproject`.
3. Use `git_source` in your job definition as described [here](https://dbx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/python/devops/notebook/?h=git_source#using-git_source-to-specify-the-remote-source)

## CI/CD pipeline settings

Please set the following secrets or environment variables for your CI provider:
- `DATABRICKS_HOST`
- `DATABRICKS_TOKEN`

## Testing and releasing via CI pipeline

- To trigger the CI pipeline, simply push your code to the repository. If CI provider is correctly set, it shall trigger the general testing pipeline
- To trigger the release pipeline, get the current version from the `myproject/__init__.py` file and tag the current code version:
```
git tag -a v<your-project-version> -m "Release tag for version <your-project-version>"
git push origin --tags
```
